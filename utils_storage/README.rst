Introduction
============

This module contains the implementation of a |RecS| |SP| that writes data into
text files in a configurable format. The current implementation provides
support for the following format:

* *comma-separated value* (|CSV|) format.

The expected usage of this plug-in is with the |RecS| *Converter* tool, to
convert an existing database from a previous recording into a set of text
file(s) containing the data in the specified format format.

Requirements
------------

To use this plug-in you will need:

- RTI Connext Professional version 6.0.0 or higher.
- CMake version 3.7 or higher
- A target platform supported by *RTI* |RecS|.

Capabilities and Usage
======================

CSV Format
----------
This plug-in stores the data provided to the *Output* |SP| in |CSV| format. By
default, the plug-in generates a separate |CSV| file for each *Topic*. The
content and format of each file is a follows:

.. list-table:: |CSV| file format
    :name: TableCsvFileFormat
    :widths: 15 20 10 10 10 10

    * - Row 1: Topic Entry
      - ``Topic name: <Name>``
      -
      -
      -
      -
    * - Row 2: Type Header
      - ``timestamp``
      - ``member1``
      - ``member2``
      - ...
      - ``memberN``
    * - Row 3: Data values
      - Reception timestamp  in nanoseconds of the sample
      - Value for member1
      - Value for member2
      - ...
      - Value for member2

The name of the file is formed using the topic name and has ``.csv`` extension.
All the files are placed in a directory that can be specified in the
plug-in configuration.

.. note::

    If the topic name contains characters that cannot appear in the file name
    because they are reserved by the underlying operating system, these characters
    will be replaced by the token ``#``.

Mapping of a data sample into columns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

General case
""""""""""""

As shown in the table above, a data sample is represented in a single row
comprising  multiple columns. Each cell holds only a value for a *final* or
leaf member in a complex data type. That is, for a member whose type is
a *Simple* type (integer, char, short), enumeration, or *String*.

Each data value in a cell corresponds to a member whose name is in the
type header. Given a complex data type, the name for a member is constructed
as follows:

::

    .<parent_member1>.<parent_member2>...<parent_memberN>.<final_member>

where ``<parent_member>`` is the name of the parent complex member that
contains the subsequent member.

If either ``<parent_member>`` or ``<final_member>`` is a *Collection* type
(array or sequence), the member name is suffixed with ``[<index>]`` an a column
for each possible element in the *Collection* is created.

Example
+++++++

Consider the following type described in IDL:

::

    struct NestedStruct {
        long m_long;
    };

    struct TopLevelStruct {
        String m_string;
        long m_array[2];
        NestedStruct m_complex;
        NestedStruct m_complex_array[2];
    };

The resulting type header row will look as follows:

.. list-table::
    :name: TableExampleTypeHeaderRow

    * - .m_string
      - .m_array[0]
      - .m_array[1]
      - .m_complex.a_long
      - .m_complex_array[0].a_long
      - .m_complex_array[1].a_long


.. note::

    Considerations about collection types: due to the column consistency
    required by the |CSV| format, the mapping of a collection type **requires
    to generate as many columns as elements can be present in the collection**,
    even if for a given data sample only a few of them are present (e.g., for
    ``Sequence`` type). If the recorded type has collections with big sizes,
    the generated file may hit the column limit of some |CSV| processor.

Sequences
"""""""""

The mapping of a ``Sequence`` type is based on the mapping of a *Collection*
type explained above with the particularity that includes an additional
column to indicate the length of the sequence. That is:

::

    .<seq_member.length>.<seq_member[0]>...<seq_member[N-1>

where the column ``<seq_member.length>`` indicates how many elements are set
in the sequence (the number of columns with non-null values) and ``N`` is the
maximum length of the sequence.

Example
+++++++

Consider the following type described in IDL:

::

    struct StructType {
        sequence<long, 4> m_seq;
    };

The resulting type header row will look as follows:

.. list-table::
    :name: TableSeqTypeHeaderRow

    * - .m_seq.length
      - .m_seq[0]
      - .m_seq[1]
      - .m_seq[2]
      - .m_seq[3]


Unions
""""""

The mapping of an ``Union`` type is similar to an ``Struct`` type except that
a discriminator column with name ``disc`` is placed before all the members.

Example
+++++++

Consider the following type described in IDL:

::

    union UnionType switch (long) {
        case 0:
        long case1;

        case 1:
        StructType case2;

        default:
        long case_default;
    };

    struct StructType {
        UnionType m_union;
    };

The resulting type header row will look as follows:

.. list-table::
    :name: TableUnionTypeHeaderRow

    * - .m_union.disc
      - .m_union.case1
      - .m_union.case2
      - .m_union.default


Data Values
"""""""""""
For a given data sample, the value for each member is placed under the
corresponding column represented as a ``String``, which applies to all primitive
types. By default, enumerations are printed with their corresponding text label.

A value for a column may not available in per-sample basis. This may occur for
the following situations:

* A Sequence member that does not contain all the possible elements.
* An Union member, which can only set a member at a time.
* An optional member, which may or may not be set.

By default, the value of an empty member is represented as ``nil``.

Example
+++++++

Consider the following type described in IDL:

::

    struct StructType {
        sequence<long, 2> m_sequence;
        @optional String m_optional;
    };

And two samples with the following values (represented in ``JSON``):

.. code:: JSON

    {
        "m_sequence": [1, 2],
        "m_optional": "hello"
    }

    {
        "m_sequence": [1],
        "m_optional":
    }

The resulting type header row and two data values row will look as follows:

.. list-table::
    :name: TableEmptyMembersExample

    * - .m_sequence.length
      - .m_sequence[0]
      - .m_sequence[1]
      - .m_optional
    * - 2
      - 1
      - 2
      - hello
    * - 1
      - 1
      - nil
      - nil


Plug-in Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The plug-in can be configured through the use of name-vale pair properties that
can be specified in the *RTI Recording Service* XML configuration file within
the tag ``<output_storage>`` for the *converter* tool (``<converter>``).

The set of available properties this plug-in supports is shown in table below:

.. list-table:: Plug-in Configuration Properties
    :name: TablePlug-inProperties
    :widths: 30 10 60
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Name |br|
        <base_name> = **rti.recording.utils_storage**
      - Value
      - Description
    * - **<base_name>.output_dir_path**
      - ``<string>``
      - Absolute or relative path to where generated file(s) are placed. |br|
        Default: **.** (working directory)
    * - **<base_name>.output_file_basename**
      - ``<string>``
      - Prefix for the name of the generated file(s). The file generated for
        each topic has the following name: |br|

            ``[OUTPUT_FILE_BASE_NAME]-[TOPIC_NAME]`` |br|

        If the option to merge the output file is enabled, then the final file
        name is equal to ``[OUTPUT_FILE_BASE_NAME]``. |br|
        Default: **csv_converted**
    * - **<base_name>.merge_output_files**
      - ``<boolean>``
      - Specifies whether the generated files shall be consolidated into
        a single file. |br|

    * - **<base_name>.verbosity**
      - ``<integer> [0 - 5]``
      - Sets the verbosity level of the plug-in. See ``rti::config::Verbosity``
        for the different levels available.
        Default: **1** (Exceptions)
    * - **<base_name>.csv.empty_member_value**
      - ``<string>``
      - Sets the value used for data members that are not present or empty.
        Default: **nil**
    * - **<base_name>.csv.enum_as_string**
      - ``<boolean>``
      - Indicates whether values for enumeration members are printed as their
        corresponding label string or as an integer. |br|
        Default: **true**
